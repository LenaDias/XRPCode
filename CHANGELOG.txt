# Version 1.0.3

This is the staging version for bluetooth

#### Bluetooth
* The XRP will need to be reset after the initial install of this software
* When you click CONNECT it will bring up a list of XRPs that are near the computer
    * If you want a cable instead, click cancel and it will go to the cable dialog
* The Bluetooth XRP name is unique per XRP. The one closest should have the strongest signal
* Once connected the IDE should be the same as if connected via a cable
* If the XRP is reset / turned off / too far away the IDE will show RE-CONNECT XRP for 10 seconds and then switch to CONNECT.
    * If the XRP is turned back on / brought closer the IDE will auto re-connect to the XRP within that 10 seconds

#### Fixed
* Input is now accepted in XRP applications
* The REPL stays live from run to run and has information from the last running program like globals and classes
    *When STOP is used the REPL is reset.
