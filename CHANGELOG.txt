# Version 3

This version has a lot of exciting updates. 

#### UI updates
In this update, you will see a number of changes that are part of
a new visual style for the IDE. The new UI isn't complete, but you'll
be able to see the direction that it is going.

#### How programs run
* All programs are now run in a try, except, finally block. This will catch and display
any exceptions that occur when the program is running.
* The finally block runs the `/lib/XRPLib/resetbot.py` This program resets the
main parts of the robot:
   * Motors
   * Servos
   * LED
   * IMU 

#### Fixed some CONNECT XRP problems
* Sometimes the XRP would not connect or would display an error
indicating MicroPython is not loaded even though it was. 
* STOP would not always stop the program.

#### vscode 
vscode key bindings are now used when editing a MicroPython program

#### "Save as" changes
* The program name is now highlighted and ready to edit.
* If you don't include an extension, then the original file extension
will be used.

#### STOPing programs
* Occasionaly you might have to push the STOP button
more than once to stop a program. It should be rare.

#### Getting help
* There are support forums now. To find them click on the USER GUIDE
button and scroll to the bottom of the introduction page.

#### example programs
* When the new libraries install you will now see an `XRPExamples`
directory with example programs in it.

## Fixes to the XRPLib

#### Rangefinder
* Fixed a bug where programs that used both the rangefinder and a sleep
timer would hang.

#### Webserver 
* A user can now setup a `secrets.json` file to feed the parameters for
the Network Name(SSID) and Password
* Webserver log file is now called `webserverLog.txt` instead
of log.txt
* For the latest changes to the API click the XRP API button at
the top of XRPCode.

#### DifferentialDrive now has an `arcade` function
The arcade function can independently control the direction and
speed of the robot. This is ideal for writing programs that use
proportional control for driving and turning.

#### Improvements to the gyro accuracy

#### Other general bug fixes
