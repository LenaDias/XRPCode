Version 2.0
Due to some of the changes to the Blockly old .blocks files may no longer work.
   You can try loading your .blocks files. If a file will not load then right click on it
   and delete the file. If it does load, then click on FILE and then SAVE TO XRP. This
   will cause the file to be saved in the new format. If some of the blocks have "holes" in them,
   you should delete that block and re-insert the block again.

Export to PC now works better for .blocks files.
