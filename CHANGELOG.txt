## Fixes to the XRPLib

timer would hang.

#### Webserver 
* A user can now setup a `secrets.json` file to feed the parameters for
the Network Name(SSID) and Password
* Webserver log file is now called `webserverLog.txt` instead
of log.txt
* For the latest changes to the API click the XRP API button at
the top of XRPCode.

#### DifferentialDrive now has an `arcade` function
The arcade function can independently control the direction and
speed of the robot. This is ideal for writing programs that use
proportional control for driving and turning.
